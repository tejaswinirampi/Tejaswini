    <p><i>Diwali, also known as Deepawali, is India’s biggest and most important holiday of the year. The festival gets its name from the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light outside their homes to symbolize the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness. For Hindus, Diwali holds profound cultural and spiritual significance, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil12. It’s a time for prayer, feasts, fireworks, and family gatherings, celebrating the victory of good over evil across various faiths in India and its diaspora</i>.</p>
